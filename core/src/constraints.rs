/// An abstract set of layout constraints.
///
/// Concrete layout models (such as box) will create concrete subclasses to
/// communicate layout constraints between parents and children.
///
/// ## Writing a Constraints subclass
///
/// When creating a new [RenderObject] subclass with a new layout protocol, one
/// will usually need to create a new [Constraints] subclass to express the
/// input to the layout algorithms.
///
/// A [Constraints] subclass should be immutable (all fields final). There are
/// several members to implement, in addition to whatever fields, constructors,
/// and helper methods one may find useful for a particular layout protocol:
///
/// * The [isTight] getter, which should return true if the object represents a
///   case where the [RenderObject] class has no choice for how to lay itself
///   out. For example, [BoxConstraints] returns true for [isTight] when both
///   the minimum and maximum widths and the minimum and maximum heights are
///   equal.
///
/// * The [isNormalized] getter, which should return true if the object
///   represents its data in its canonical form. Sometimes, it is possible for
///   fields to be redundant with each other, such that several different
///   representations have the same implications. For example, a
///   [BoxConstraints] instance with its minimum width greater than its maximum
///   width is equivalent to one where the maximum width is set to that minimum
///   width (`2<w<1` is equivalent to `2<w<2`, since minimum constraints have
///   priority). This getter is used by the default implementation of
///   [debugAssertIsValid].
///
/// * The [debugAssertIsValid] method, which should assert if there's anything
///   wrong with the constraints object. (We use this approach rather than
///   asserting in constructors so that our constructors can be `const` and so
///   that it is possible to create invalid constraints temporarily while
///   building valid ones.) See the implementation of
///   [BoxConstraints.debugAssertIsValid] for an example of the detailed checks
///   that can be made.
///
/// * The [==] operator and the [hashCode] getter, so that constraints can be
///   compared for equality. If a render object is given constraints that are
///   equal, then the rendering library will avoid laying the object out again
///   if it is not dirty.
///
/// * The [toString] method, which should describe the constraints so that they
///   appear in a usefully readable form in the output of [debugDumpRenderTree].
